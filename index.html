                    This series gives a lot of big messages. <br>
                    First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. <br>
                    Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. <br>
                    He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. <br>
                    The masks represent this irregularity.

                        is not a hero—far from it. <br>
                        A heartless bon vivant, Berlin is able to sing "Bella Ciao" <br>
                        as passionately as he commits acts of violence.Part madman, part leading man,  <br>
                        Berlin is captivating precisely because he's so unpredictable.

                        She is a member of the heist crew set to rob the Royal Mint of Spain. <br>
                        (Úrsula Corberó) began questioning the gang's operation, resulting in Berlin (Pedro Alonso) <br>
